# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to determine whether the surf shop can be sustainable all year round. Using the data for June and December, we can find out the average temperature for those months which can give an idea if the surf shop will be viable all year round.

## Results

### December Analysis

### Key points
* There is a big difference in the minimum temperature where Decemeber lowest temperature was 56 degrees while June was 64.
* There are alot more data points from June compare to December which has around 200 less point.
* All the quartile range for June is within the 70 to 80 degree mark while December only within 65 to 75 degree mark.

## Summary
Overall I believe that the surf shop can stay open all year round due to the average whether being above 70 degrees. One additionaly query result that would help refine the data more is to filter more temperature data on days with precipitation of a certain range which can help determine the number of days that the shop would be open during the day that are not raining hard. Another additional query that can help is counting temperature datapoints from a set range of the most active stations which can help provide more concise measurements.
